## Entrepreneur | Developer | Designer | Futurist

I was born and raised on a cattle ranch in west central Wyoming where my family homesteaded in 1893.  I've always been fascinated by technology and struggled to straddle the divide that seems to have developed between the western heritage that I grew up in and the future led by technological advancements.  With an innate curiosity to understand how the world functions, I've been drawn to macroeconomics and monetary policy. It seems somewhat fortuitous that Wyoming has taken the lead in blockchain technology which combines my most captivating curiosities.  

With 18 years of local and regional experience in, business, marketing, graphic design, web design, I see the vast opportunities in blockchain, digital assets and decentralization and am eager to take part.  I have been accumulating knowledge as rapidly as possible around blockchain, code, system administration, DApp development, and DeFi.   I truly believe blockchain and decentralized technologies are the new frontier.

If you're running or are involved in a blockchain related project and in need of a motivated person with my skill set, for employment, partnership or simply networking in Wyoming, please contact me.  

Thank you,
Heath
